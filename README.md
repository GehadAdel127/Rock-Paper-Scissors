### ðŸ“„ Rock-Paper-Scissors Game â€“ Description

This Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a simple web-based implementation built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows a user to play the classic game against the computer.

#### ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:

* **HTML** is used to structure the content, including buttons for the playerâ€™s choices (Rock, Paper, Scissors), headings, and result display areas.
* **CSS** styles the interface, giving the game a clean and interactive look. It manages layout, button design, hover effects, and spacing.
* **JavaScript** handles the game logic:

  * Detects the player's choice through button clicks.
  * Randomly generates the computer's move.
  * Compares both choices and determines the winner based on traditional game rules.
  * Updates the user interface dynamically with the result and choices made.

#### ðŸŽ® Gameplay Flow:

1. The player clicks one of the three buttons: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. The computer randomly selects its move.
3. The result is calculated:

   * Rock beats Scissors
   * Scissors beats Paper
   * Paper beats Rock
   * Same choices result in a tie
4. The choices and outcome are displayed on the screen.

This project demonstrates core web development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, conditionals, and basic UI design. Itâ€™s great for beginners learning how to connect front-end structure with interactive logic.
